# MultiDesktopItemViewSaver

Current project is evolution (and if saying more accurate - remake) of respective app from the book of J.Richter and C.Nasarre "Windows VIA C/C++". That program was a pretty simple and had a few bugs and simplifications in it. My program is not so complex too, but I fixed that just mentioned bugs and added a some more functionality. In particular, now it can save and restore configuration (saved in registry) for each unique combination of desktop displays.

For make this working I impliment two auxillary classes - first for retriving general information about displays and second for connecting previous one with registry settings.

The usage of program is simple enough.
